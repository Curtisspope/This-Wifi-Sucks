This mobile project in Beta is a cooperative effort between Lead Programmer: me and Lead Designer: [Lance Weisser](lanceweisser.portfoliobox.me).

This WiFi Sucks is a free app that allows you to anonymously rate the WiFi wherever you go and share your perception of your network with your peers as well as the Hotels, Coffee shops and Airports you frequent. Through this crowd sourced effort, travelers will be able to find the best WiFi. Great WiFi is a necessity and we want to share it with the world.
